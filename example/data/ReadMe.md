#### Description of simulated data.

This dataset represents a single frame (time-step) of a larger MD simulation of a bilayer membrane, which was generated for a study of phase behavior of ternary lipid mixtures. The results of the study were published in a [recent paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jctc.8b00496) (*LLNL-JRNL-750094*). The study was funded by DOE NNSA as part of the JDACS4C project.

#### Description of Simulated Data

This dataset represents a single frame (time-step) of a larger molecular dynamics simulation of a bilayer membrane, which was generated by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) for a study of phase behavior of ternary lipid mixtures. LLNL published the results of the study in a [recent paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jctc.8b00496) (*LLNL-JRNL-750094*). The Department of Energy (DOE) National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) funded the study as part of the Joint Design of Advanced Computing Solutions for Cancer (JDACS4C) project.
